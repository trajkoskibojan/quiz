# Work Sample

## What youâ€™ll be doing
You will be creating a trivia game where the player gets to answer questions and collect points for each correct answer.

## How does the game work
See a clickable prototype of the game here: https://www.figma.com/proto/dXm07U7mb9cYyl32HamLK7/TriviaTime

## Expectations
We expect you to create the game as a React web application. The application should be mobile first and if possible also look good on a desktop screen. It should be built only with functions without using class components.

You can use whatever styling technology and libraries that you are comfortable with. You can build the project by either using Javascript or Typescript.

Apart from project documentation, the finished work sample should have a readme file describing how to get the application up and running.

## Delivery
We want you to return your work to us in the following way:

- **The code** hosted as a private repository on Github or similar GIT based service under your own profile. Please share this with info@metergram.com.
- **A live demo** at a URL where we can view the finished application up and running.

When we meet, we want you to show us the code and talk about why you've made choices regarding application structure and how you approached the work.

## Have fun!
This test is not about pointing fingers or say you did something wrong. We want to see how you think, how you organize a project from scratch and how you implement a common task into code.
